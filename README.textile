h2. Infinite Monkey Wrench

Starting from scratch, implementing only what is necessary and useful, making sure all code is testable and extensible.

h2. Do Want

* Be able to open any URI dynamically, and understand the data in a correct way.
* Be able to open a URI and recordize the data given a schema.
* Be able to write out to a URI dynamically, recordizing with an optional modifier.

<pre><code>Would like implementation to appear as follows:
my_record_reader = IMW::Reader.new(:my_schema)
my_record_writer = IMW::Writer.new("path/to/output", :format)
my_record_reader.open("uri/encoded/path/to/data") do |data|
  # do stuff to data
  my_record_writer.write(data)
end
</code></pre>

== Contributing to imw
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
