h2. Infinite Monkey Wrench

Starting from scratch, implementing only what is necessary and useful, making sure all code is testable and extensible.

h2. Do Want

* Be able to open any URI dynamically, and understand the data in a correct way.
* Be able to open a URI and recordize the data given a schema.
* Be able to write out to a URI dynamically, recordizing with an optional modifier.

<pre><code>Would like implementation to appear as follows:
my_record_reader = IMW::Reader.new(:my_schema)
my_record_writer = IMW::Writer.new("path/to/output", :format)
my_record_reader.open("uri/encoded/path/to/data") do |data|
  # do stuff to data
  my_record_writer.write(data)
end
</code></pre>
